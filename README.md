# Chess
I would like to write a program that computes the cover-maps of various chess openings.


Let's be real people, I'm an amateur and this isn't a professional venture.  Don't use this to make any $, although I doubt you could.  Send any suggestions, chess memes, or game lore you think is interesting.  Keep it classy.
